    "# 🔎 Agent Observability - Logs, Traces & Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to Day 4 of the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Day 3, you learned the **\"What, Why & How\" of Session and Memory management**, focusing on long-term, short-term, and shared memory (state). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you'll learn:\n",
    "- How to add observability to the agent you've built and\n",
    "- How to evaluate if the agents are working as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on the first part - **Agent Observability!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Agent Observability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚨 The challenge:** Unlike traditional software that fails predictably, AI agents can fail mysteriously. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Find quantum computing papers\"\n",
    "Agent: \"I cannot help with that request.\"\n",
    "You: 😭 WHY?? Is it the prompt? Missing tools? API error?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 The Solution:** Agent observability gives you complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process. You'll see exactly what prompts are sent to the LLM, which tools are available, how the model responds, and where failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DEBUG Log: LLM Request shows \"Functions: []\" (no tools!)\n",
    "You: 🎯 Aha! Missing google_search tool - easy fix!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundational pillars of Agent Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logs:** A log is a record of a single event, telling you **what** happened at a specific moment.\n",
    "2. **Traces:** A trace connects the logs into a single story, showing you **why** a final result occurred by revealing the entire sequence of steps.\n",
    "3. **Metrics:** Metrics are the summary numbers (like averages and error rates) that tell you **how** well the agent is performing overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/observability-intro.png\">\n",

    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, you'll:**\n",

    "* ✅ Set up logging configuration\n",
    "* ✅ Create a broken agent. Use `adk web` UI & logs to identify exactly why the agent fails\n",
    "* ✅ Understand how to implement logging in production\n",
