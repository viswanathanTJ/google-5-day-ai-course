It applies software development principles to AI agent creation, making it easier for developers to build, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures, ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, making it compatible with other frameworks.\n",
